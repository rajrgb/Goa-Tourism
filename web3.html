            A native of Goa is called a Goan. Goa has a population of 1.459 million residents as of 2011,[49][better
            source
            needed] making it India's fourth smallest (after Sikkim, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh). The population has
            a
            growth rate of 8.23% per decade. There are 394 people for each square kilometre of land which is higher than
            national average 382 per km2. Goa is the state with highest proportion of urban population with 62.17% of
            the
            population living in urban areas. The sex ratio is 973 females to 1,000 males. The birth rate is 15.70 per
            1,000
            people in 2007. Goa also is the state with lowest proportion of Scheduled Tribes at 0.04%.[50] A relatively
            small Goan-Portuguese mixed race population resulted from Portuguese colonisation, one estimate being that
            less
            than 100 mestiço families left in 1961 when Portugal lost the colony.[51] Estimates put the migrant, or
            non-Goan, population at 20% of the population, with a state government study projecting that by 2021 the
            migrant
            community will outnumber the native population.

                According to the 2011 census, in a population of 1,458,545 people, 66.1% were Hindu, 25.1% were
                Christian,
                8.3% were Muslim and 0.1% were Sikh.[59]

                Due to the economic decline of Portuguese India from the 18th century, there was a large-scale migration
                of
                Goan Catholics. The local Indian Christians were called "indiacatos" and the mixed population, mestiços
                by
                the Portuguese. The population moved from 64.5% Christian and 35% Hindu in 1851 to 50% Christian and 50%
                Hindu in 1900, with a steady increase in the Hindu proportion from then onwards.[60]

                The Catholics in Goa state and Daman and Diu union territory are served by the Metropolitan Roman
                Catholic
                Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, the primatial see of India, in which the titular Patriarchate of the East
                Indies is vested.

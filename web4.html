            Having been a Portuguese territory for over 450 years, Goan culture is an amalgamation of both Eastern and
            Western styles, with the latter having a more dominant role. The tableau of Goa showcases religious harmony
            by
            focusing on the Deepastambha, the Cross and Ghode Modni followed by a chariot. Western royal attire of kings
            is
            as much part of Goa's cultural heritage as are regional dances performed depicting a unique blend of
            different
            religions and cultures of this State. Prominent local festivals are Christmas, Easter, Carnival, Diwali,
            Shigmo,
            Chavoth, Samvatsar Padvo, Dasara etc. The Goan Carnival and Christmas-new year celebrations attract many
            tourists.

            The Gomant Vibhushan Award, the highest civilian honour of the State of Goa, is given annually by Government
            of
            Goa since 2010.
            <br>
            Traditional Goan art forms are Dekhnni, Fugdi, Corridinho, Mando, Dulpod and Fado.[73] Goan Catholics are
            fond
            of social gatherings and Tiatr (Teatro). As part of its Portuguese history, music is an integral part of
            Goan
            homes. It is often said that "Goans are born with music and sport". Western musical instruments like the
            piano,
            guitars and violins are widely used in most religious and social functions of the Catholics.
            <br>
            Goan Hindus are very fond of Natak, Bhajan and Kirtan.[citation needed] Many famous Indian classical singers
            hail from Goa, including Mogubai Kurdikar, Kishori Amonkar, Kesarbai Kerkar, Jitendra Abhisheki and Pandit
            Prabhakar Karekar.[citation needed]

            Goa is also known as the origin of Goa trance.

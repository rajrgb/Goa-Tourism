            Rice with fish curry (xit koddi in Konkani) is the staple diet in Goa. Goan cuisine is famous for its rich
            variety of fish dishes cooked with elaborate recipes. Coconut and coconut oil are widely used in Goan
            cooking
            along with chili peppers, spices, and vinegar is used in the Catholic cuisine, giving the food a unique
            flavour.
            The Goan cuisine is heavily influenced by Portuguese cuisine.

            Goan food may be divided into Goan Catholic and Goan Hindu cuisine with each showing very distinct tastes,
            characteristics, and cooking styles. Pork dishes such as Vindalho, Xacuti, chouri√ßo, and Sorpotel are cooked
            for
            major occasions among the Goan Catholics. An exotic Goan vegetable stew, known as Khatkhate, is a very
            popular
            dish during the celebrations of festivals, Hindu and Christian alike. Khatkhate contains at least five
            vegetables, fresh coconut, and special Goan spices that add to the aroma.

            Sannas, Hitt, are variants of idli and Polle, Amboli, and Kailoleo are variants of dosa; all are native to
            Goa.
            A rich egg-based, multi-layered sweet dish known as bebinca is a favourite at Christmas.

            There are some places in Goa which are famous for Goa's traditional & special cuisines. Ros omelette is one
            of
            the most popular snacks and street foods in Goa, it is traditionally sold on food carts on streets.
            <br>
            The most popular alcoholic beverage in Goa is feni; cashew feni is made from the fermentation of the fruit
            of
            the cashew tree, while coconut feni is made from the sap of toddy palms. Urrak is another local liquor
            prepared
            from Cashew fruit. In fact the bar culture is one of the unique aspects of the Goan villages where a local
            bar
            serves as a meeting point for villagers to unwind.[85] Goa also has a rich wine culture.

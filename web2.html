            Goa is a
            state on the southwestern coast of India within the region known as
            the Konkan, and geographically separated from the Deccan highlands by the Western Ghats.[7][8] It is
            surrounded
            by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea
            forming its western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and the fourth-smallest by population. Goa
            has
            the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states,[9] two and a half times that of the country.[10] It was
            ranked the best-placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for
            the
            best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.[10]
            <br>
            Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Marg√£o still
            exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the subcontinent in the early 16th
            century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa was a former state of the Portuguese Empire. The
            Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by India
            in
            1961.[11][12] Its majority and official language is Konkani.

            Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its white sand beaches,
            nightlife, places of worship and World Heritage-listed architecture. It has rich flora and fauna, owing to
            its
            location on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot.
